# Upgrade from v1.1 to v1.2

### Breaking Changes

- In version 1.2, we have standardized the difference between the methods that can be overridden in custom elements in 'model' and 'view'. If you do not need to change the DOM structure of an element but only modify its style based on the properties in the model, you can override the method provided by the model to get the style. If you need to change the DOM structure of the element, you need to override the method provided by the 'view' to modify the DOM structure. The detailed modification methods are as follows:
  1. The 'getArrowStyle' method in 'view' is deprecated, please use the 'getArrowStyle' method in 'model' instead.

- In version 1.1, LogicFlow provided the feature of automatically expanding the canvas area when dragging nodes or edges to the canvas boundary. However, based on the feedback received, this feature resulted in certain explanation costs. Therefore, in version 1.2, this feature is disabled by default. You can enable it by passing the 'autoExpand' parameter as 'true' when initializing LogicFlow. It is now set as 'false' by default.

- In version 1.2, we have optimized the support for React 18.
